# Runimation
A project to help me learn computer graphics by connecting it to a passion of mine: running.

I got to a point in my career where I felt I need to pivot more than just learning about new architectures like TCA.
I also took running way more seriously than I should have, chasing numbers on the watch.

This project aims to reignites the fire in me for running, programming and art. How, you might ask. The answer is simple, by tring to have fun with them all. :)
